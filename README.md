# Pipeline for Estimating Human Admixture Events

Human populations have been in interaction with each other throughout history. This suggests a steady exchange of genetic information in which new populations have developed by admixture of existing populations. This project has focused on pipelining the use of such tools as ChromoPainterv2 and GLOBETROTTER in order to create a single tool with which to study human admixture.

## Programmes  
All programmes used in this pipeline are open source and can be downloaded from the following sites:  
* Beagle version 4 -- http://faculty.washington.edu/browning/beagle/beagle.html  
* ChromoPainterv2, GLOBETROTTER, neaverage.pl -- http://www.paintmychromosomes.com/  

## Running the Pipeline  
./script.sh -d donor-populations -r recipient-populations
